I come from china and I'm trying to not use chinese to write the file.

Note:
The project is a cross-platform simple server framework based on boost.asio and redis. Actually it's just a network and redis framework.
If you use it,you may need logger system,memorycycle system,a sql database,serialization tools and your own protocol.

Compile with msvc140 is easy.I am adding CMakeLists for it,cmake will surport on next commit.
