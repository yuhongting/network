A cross-platform simple server framework based on boost.asio and redis.Actually is just a network and redis framework.
If use it,you may need logger,memorycycle system,sql database,serialization tools and your own protocol.

Compile with msvc140 is easy.I am adding CMakeLists for it,cmake will surport on next commit.
